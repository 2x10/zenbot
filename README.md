# zenbot

a minecraft bot with a discord chatbridge made with mineflayer and discord.js

the "config.js" file is all you need to edit to setup this bot.
it needs the minecraft server information, minecraft account credentials, a discord server id and channel id and 4 discord webhooks to function properly.



it was originally made for minecraft anarchy servers such as 2b2t, but it definitely has some issues.



to actually run the bot, all you gotta do is clone this repository, open the command-line and open the repository, run "npm install" to download the node modules and then run "node ." to start the bot.
