# zenbot
a minecraft bot with a discord chatbridge made with mineflayer and discord.js

the "config.js" file is all you need to edit to setup this bot.
you need to pretty much do everything as wanted in the configuration file.
it needs minecraft server information, minecraft account credentials, a discord server id and channel id and 4 discord webhooks to function properly.
